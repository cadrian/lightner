    <p>
      A simple <b>Leitner box</b>, with an obvious pun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea comes from this video (in
      French): <a href="https://youtu.be/RVB3PBPxMWg?si=XpXQtJGPC9fH68oj"><b>Science
      Étonnante</b> — MIEUX APPRENDRE & ÉTUDIER : les (vraies)
      techniques scientifiques</a>.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
